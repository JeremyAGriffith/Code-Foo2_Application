2)  Create a liquid layout with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This layout must support the following resolutions: 1024x768, 1680x1050. Explain why you would use a liquid layout.

There are a seemingly endless number of monitor sizes, and even if the government mandated that all screens from now on be made only one dimension, the internet could be viewed by people still using their old monitors.  A liquid layout allows a website to accommodate all the different screen sizes of the world without potential gaps of just background or much worse, lots of scrolling left and right.  By making all the containers on a site have widths described in percentages, everything will dynamically resize with browser window and monitor dimensions.  As good as a liquid layout can be, it is probably not a perfect replacement for a mobile layout, due to the extreme screen sizing limitations.
